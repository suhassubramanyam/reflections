When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  	When multiple people are working on the project or if I want to share the project with the public, 
  	I would use remote repository rather than local

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	We might be working on something and without our knowledge the remote change can be incorporated into our code messing things up.
	So it's better to let it happen manually so that we have more control over it.
