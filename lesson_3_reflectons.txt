When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  	When multiple people are working on the project or if I want to share the project with the public, 
  	I would use remote repository rather than local

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	We might be working on something and without our knowledge the remote change can be incorporated into our code messing things up.
	So it's better to let it happen manually so that we have more control over it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	forks : copy from one github repository to my account giving credits to the owner
	clones : copy repository from local to local or github to local
	branches : new feature, bug fix etc

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	So that we can work offline and compare it to our local branch. One consistent state.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	It would be very difficult without Git. Tracking different changes by many people working on the same 
	project would be difficult. Only easy thing without git would be the head ache of commiting everytime 
	we make a logical change,etc.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
	When I want to work on a new experimental feature and don't want to disturb the master branch until I'm sure it's working
	perfectly. Working directly on master reduces confusion, but may cause problems if it's not working properly and it's not 
	safe to disturb the production code(master branch).
