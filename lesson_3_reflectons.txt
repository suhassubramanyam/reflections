When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  	When multiple people are working on the project or if I want to share the project with the public, 
  	I would use remote repository rather than local

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	We might be working on something and without our knowledge the remote change can be incorporated into our code messing things up.
	So it's better to let it happen manually so that we have more control over it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	forks : copy from one github repository to my account giving credits to the owner
	clones : copy repository from local to local or github to local
	branches : new feature, bug fix etc
